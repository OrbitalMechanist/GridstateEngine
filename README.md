# Gridstate Engine #
### COMP 8551 ###

This will, eventually, be an engine for turn-based tactics games and/or CRPGs with
turn based combat.

For now, however, it is just the rendering backend (we will hopefully hook up actual
gameplay to it at some point.)

Currently only works on Windows due to certain libraries being DLLs, might be able to
change that later though.
